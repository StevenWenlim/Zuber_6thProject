# Zuber_6thProject
This project is my project in sprint 2, which is Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this srpint i learn structured databases and the process of retrieving data using SQL.

# Project Overview
As an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launched in Chicago, I was asked to identify patterns in the available information. I must find passenger preferences and the impact of weather changes on trips.

Based on the observation and visualization, here are some findings that I obtained:
1.	The 5 most frequently visited destinations by taxi passengers: Loop, River North, Streeterville, West Loop, and O'Hare.
2.	The 5 companies with the highest number of trips are as follows: Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, Medallion Leasing, Yellow Cab, and Taxi Affiliation Service Yellow
3.	The average duration of a trip from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport is not the same on rainy Saturdays.

Based on the analysis, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:
1.	To increase customer satisfaction, focus on providing rides to the top destinations visited by taxi passengers.
2.	Consider implementing surge pricing during rainy Saturdays to reflect the longer trip duration and encourage drivers to continue offering rides during these conditions.
3.	Use weather data to forecast potential changes in demand and adjust driver availability accordingly.
